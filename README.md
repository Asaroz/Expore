# Expore

## The custom world building application

Build your own custom world:
- Create continents, species, nations, atmospheres, or anything you like.
- Make new objects or themes as subitems.
- Create a giant tree of objects and information.
- The only limit is your imagination! (and maybe our database bandwidth XD)
