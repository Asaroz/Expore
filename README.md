# Expore

## The custom universe building application

Build your own custom universe:
- Create continents, species, nations, atmospheres, or anything you like.
- Make new objects or themes as subitems.
- Create a giant tree of objects and information.
- The only limit is your imagination! (and maybe our database bandwidth XD)

    - jwt
    - nodemon

## Get Started

- The backend is in the root folder and serves the frontend in the client folder
- Open the folders, ```npm install``` and you are good to go
    - for backend development: ```npm run dev``` starting the server with nodemon
    - for frontend development: ```cd client | npm run start``` starting the React application

### Workflow

    - To make a new branch: ```git checkout -b <your own branch>```
